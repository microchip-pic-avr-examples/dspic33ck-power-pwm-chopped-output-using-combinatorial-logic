# dspic33ck-power-pwm-push-pull, release v1.0.0

### Release Highlights
This is the initial release demonstrating the basic configuration of a high-resolution PWM generator of the dsPIC33C family of devices.
This example is part of a series of code examples highlighting specific operating modes and features.

### Features Added\Updated
In this initial version the on-board LED of the dsPIC33CK Digital Power Plug-In Module is toggled with a interval period of 300 ms, when the controller is running at maximum speed of 100 MIPS.
After startup, PWM generator #1 is generating 100 kHz Complementary waveform at the PWM1H/PWM1L outputs while the PWM generator #3 is generating 1 MHz at the PWM3L output and the modulated PWM ouput is produce in PWM3H output.
